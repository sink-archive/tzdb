# tzdb
[DEAD] The free database for timezones

This project was stopped in development due to a timezone db existing already.

The code is hereby released under the Unlicense.

I hope this can be a useful learning tool for
 - Cloudflare Workers
 - Workers KV
   * Using Workers KV for data that needs multiple indexes
 - Semantic UI, I guess
 - Hono
 - OAuth (albeit a kind of weird way of doing it)
 - API design / semantic HTTP methods & statuses perhaps
 - Advanced typescript (see the bits where I'm working with the service names using `keyof` etc)
